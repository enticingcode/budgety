Creating new entry brings up Modal where category is selected.

Last I was working on state for the financials array, kept getting cashFlow error from ModuleInputs file.

This was due to savings allocation component being loaded with no actual array being passed.
// commented out savings component but should work once I implement the useSelector hook on 
that module.

Working on finance items only showing 7 first then view all button will bring up the rest of them.
upon bringing up the rest. react route should be used to display page.

Routing for Each individual type of cashflow(income, expense, etc). 

When clicking view all it should show all of the entries corresponding to what was clicked. right now I'm going to use the <Link state="type"> 
attribute to pass in what type it should be, and based on that prop/state with useLocation() it will show all the entries when querying redux state.
