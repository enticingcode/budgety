Last I was working on state for the financials array, kept getting cashFlow error from ModuleInputs file.

This was due to savings allocation component being loaded with no actual array being passed.
// commented out savings component but should work once I implement the useSelector hook on 
that module.

Working on finance items only showing 7 first then view all button will bring up the rest of them.
upon bringing up the rest. react route should be used to display page.
